Allows you to enter the quantity of goods in the second warehouse in the admin area and see this quantity on the product card page and on the Bookmarks page.

Changes in the admin area:
Product editing form. Data tab
New field "Quantity Warehouse2" under the field "Quantity"

User interface changes:
1) Product card. Now there are two quantities - "The presence of UGR" and "The presence of DRG"
2) Bookmarks. New field "Availability Airship" in the table.

Installation.
"Install extensions" menu, load additional-storage-ocmod.ocmod.zip file
Modifiers menu - list of installed extensions
Click the "Update" button in the upper right corner

Removal.
Menu "Modifiers" - select the "Additional storage" extension, click the Delete button in the upper right corner, click the Update button in the upper right corner.

Known issues:
1) When ordering goods, only the first warehouse is checked.
The deduction from the warehouse only occurs in the first warehouse.
2) The inscription in the absence of goods in the second warehouse is fixed and equals "In stock".
Whereas this inscription can be changed when editing an item for the first warehouse (the "Out of stock" field).
